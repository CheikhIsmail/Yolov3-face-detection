# Defining a function to calculate Intersection over Union (IoU)

This function calculates the Intersection over Union (IoU) score between two bounding boxes

as it measures the overlap between two boxes.

    (box1) and the ground truth (box2). If is_pred is True, then box1 is the prediction,

# Anchor boxes for each feature map scaled between 0 and 1
# 3 feature maps at 3 different scales based on YOLOv3 paper
'''
Anchor boxes are predefined bounding boxes with different aspect ratios and scales that are used to 
predict the location of objects in an image. During training, the model tries to match each object 
to one of the anchor boxes. The goal is to find which anchor box best fits the object in terms of 
size and shape. The idea is to use these predefined boxes as a starting point for the object 
detection predictions.
'''

]   

'''
3 feature maps at 3 different scales: This is because YOLOv3 uses multiple scales to detect objects 
of various sizes. The anchor boxes are assigned to three different feature map sizes (often corresponding 
to different layers in the network), allowing the model to detect objects from small to large.

                        appropriate one to be responsible for predicting it.
                        
                        YOLOv3 (and newer versions) predict boxes at each grid cell using predefined anchor 
                        boxes (prior shapes). These anchors differ in aspect ratios and sizes.

                        During training:
                        Each ground truth object must be assigned to exactly one anchor box on one scale.
                        This prevents multiple anchors or scales from predicting the same object 
                        (redundancy and confusion).

                        Ensure the best-shaped anchor is used.

                        Help the model converge faster and better — the anchor already resembles the 
                        ground truth, so the model needs smaller adjustments.
